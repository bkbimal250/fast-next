# Google for Jobs Integration - Job Counts in Search Results

This document explains how the SPA Jobs Portal is configured to show job counts in Google search results, similar to Naukri, Indeed, and other job portals.

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### 1. **Backend API Endpoints**

#### `/api/jobs/count` - Get Job Count
Returns the count of active jobs with optional filters (location, category, etc.)

**Example:**
```
GET /api/jobs/count?job_category=therapist&city_id=1
Response: { "count": 45 }
```

#### `/api/jobs/counts-by-location` - Get Job Counts by Location
Returns job counts grouped by city, optionally filtered by category.

**Example:**
```
GET /api/jobs/counts-by-location?job_category=therapist
Response: [
  { "city_id": 1, "city_name": "Mumbai", "city_slug": "mumbai", "job_count": 45 },
  { "city_id": 2, "city_name": "Delhi", "city_slug": "delhi", "job_count": 32 }
]
```

### 2. **Location + Category Pages**

Created dynamic pages for category + location combinations:
- **Route**: `/jobs/category/[category]/location/[location]`
- **Example**: `/jobs/category/therapist/location/mumbai`

These pages include:
- ✅ **CollectionPage Schema** with job counts
- ✅ **Breadcrumb Schema** for navigation
- ✅ **ItemList Schema** with job listings
- ✅ Dynamic job count display: "45+ jobs available"

### 3. **Enhanced Structured Data**

#### CollectionPage Schema
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "CollectionPage",
  "name": "Therapist Jobs in Mumbai",
  "description": "Find 45+ Therapist jobs in Mumbai...",
  "mainEntity": {
    "@type": "ItemList",
    "numberOfItems": 45,
    "itemListElement": [...]
  }
}
```

This schema tells Google:
- The page is a collection of jobs
- How many jobs are available (`numberOfItems`)
- The location and category context

### 4. **City Pages Enhanced**

City pages (`/cities/[city]`) now include:
- ✅ Job counts for the city
- ✅ Category links with job counts
- ✅ CollectionPage schema
- ✅ Breadcrumb schema

### 5. **Sitemap Updates**

The sitemap now includes:
- ✅ All category + location combinations (if 5+ jobs exist)
- ✅ Proper priority and changefreq settings
- ✅ Lastmod dates

**Example sitemap entries:**
```xml
<url>
  <loc>https://spajobs.com/jobs/category/therapist/location/mumbai</loc>
  <lastmod>2024-01-15</lastmod>
  <changefreq>daily</changefreq>
  <priority>0.85</priority>
</url>
```

### 6. **Breadcrumb Schema**

All pages now include breadcrumb schema for better navigation:
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
  "itemListElement": [
    { "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://spajobs.com" },
    { "position": 2, "name": "Jobs", "item": "https://spajobs.com/jobs" },
    { "position": 3, "name": "Therapist Jobs in Mumbai", "item": "..." }
  ]
}
```

## 🔍 How Google Shows Job Counts

When someone searches "therapist jobs in mumbai" on Google:

1. **Google crawls** the sitemap and discovers:
   - `/jobs/category/therapist/location/mumbai`
   - `/cities/mumbai`

2. **Google reads** the CollectionPage schema:
   - Sees `numberOfItems: 45`
   - Understands this is a job listing page
   - Sees the location and category context

3. **Google displays** in search results:
   ```
   Therapist Jobs in Mumbai | SPA Jobs Portal
   https://spajobs.com/jobs/category/therapist/location/mumbai
   
   Find 45+ Therapist jobs in Mumbai. Browse and apply to the best spa jobs...
   ```

4. **Rich Results** may show:
   - Job count: "45 jobs"
   - Location: "Mumbai"
   - Category: "Therapist"
   - Breadcrumb navigation
